;; (super-filter pred? nelst) apply the predicate to filter non-list elementfs
;; in each nested list
;; Examples:
(check-expect
 (super-filter
  odd?
  (list 1 (list 2 (list 2 3 4) 5 6 (list 7 8 9)) 10 11 12))
 (list 1 (list (list 3) 5 (list 7 9)) 11))

;; super-filter: (X -> Bool) (nested-listof X) -> (nested-listof X)

         (cons (first nelst) (super-filter pred? (rest nelst)))]
        [else (super-filter pred? (rest nelst))]))

;; Tests:
(check-expect (super-filter even? empty) empty)  
(check-expect
 (super-filter
