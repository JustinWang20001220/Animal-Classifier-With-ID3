# Animal-Classifier-With-ID3

This project is a Racket implementation of ID3 algorithm to generate decision trees

Where the input parameter is a feature vectors that each contains
- Type of animal the list of feature represents
- The list of features that the animal has

The script uses the ID3 algorithm,
generating a decision tree with potential features included for the corresponding animal by calculating entropy in each step and divide dataset into two separate group iteratively

A method also check for the sensitivity and specificity of the decision tree generated

Thanks to material provided by University of Waterloo and please see the step by step instruction on creating such algorithm in a07.pdf file.
